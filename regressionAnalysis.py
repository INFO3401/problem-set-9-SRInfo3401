#Monday:
#Submit the following functions as part of a file called regressionAnalysis.py. You will use this data to make some predictions about the nutritional aspects of various popular Halloween candies. Your code will contain three objects:

#1. Using the candy-data.csv file in the repo, populate an AnalysisData object that will hold the data you'll use for today's problem set. You should read in the data from the CSV, store the data in the dataset variable, and initialize the xs (in your variables attribute) and targetY variables appropriately. targetY should reference the variable describing whether or not a candy is chocolate.
#code from class
#dataParser = Parser("csv")
#dataParser.parseFile("candy-data.csv")
#print(dataParser.data)

candy_analysis = AnalysisData()
candy_analysis.parserFile('candy-data.csv')

#2. Create a function to initialize a LinearAnalysis object that takes a targetY as its input parameter. Create the same function for LogisticAnalysis. Note that you will use the LinearAnalysis object to try to predict the amount of sugar in the candy and the LogisticAnalysis object to predict whether or not the candy is chocolate.
#(incorporated into problem set)


#Wednesday & Friday:

#3. Add a function to the LinearAnalysis object called runSimpleAnalysis. This function should take in an AnalysisData object as a parameter and should use this object to compute which variable best predicts how much sugar a candy contains using a linear regression. Print the variable name and the resulting fit (use LaTeX: R^2 R 2  to report the fit). Make sure your best predictor is NOT the same as the targetY variable.
